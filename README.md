# Fraud-Detection-System-using-ML

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent insurance claims using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains various features related to insurance policies, customer details, and claim information.

## Data Gathering

The dataset is read from a CSV file and includes the following steps:
- Import necessary libraries
- Load the dataset using pandas

## Data Preparation

Data preparation involves cleaning and transforming the dataset to make it suitable for machine learning models. Steps include:
- Dropping irrelevant columns
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables

## Model Training

Various machine learning models can be used to train on the dataset and detect fraudulent claims. Common models include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

## Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model with the best performance is selected for deployment.

## Usage

To run the notebook, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent insurance claims. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to preparing the data, training models, and evaluating their performance.
